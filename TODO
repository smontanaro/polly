There will always be things to do...

* Access IMAP server messages more efficiently (maybe peek at headers and
  only pull the full message if we've not yet seen the message-id?

(done)

* readline/history support for the interactive prompt

* optional count arg for the password command (generate that many at one go)

(done)

* Beef up words file cheaply.

(done)

* Bad words should be remembered separately from the normal pickle so it can
  be retained across deletions of the pickle. Also, should be plain text to
  allow easy editing.

* Should get message ids all at once (how?), then quickly discard all we've
  seen.

* Need to do something other than "look back 10 days" when starting up. Not
  sure how that whole thing is supposed to work. Ideally, you'd process the
  entire folder the first time around, then "RECENT" messages after
  that. I'm sure the current scheme would be hard on lesser IMAP servers.
