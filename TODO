There will always be things to do...

* Access IMAP server messages more efficiently (maybe peek at headers and
  only pull the full message if we've not yet seen the message-id?

(done)

* readline/history support for the interactive prompt

* optional count arg for the password command (generate that many at one go)

(done)

* Beef up words file cheaply.
